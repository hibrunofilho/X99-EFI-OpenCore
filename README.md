# X99 on macOS (Hackintosh)
EFI optimized for almost all X99

**Current OpenCore:** 0.7.7

## What works on this EFI??

- Audio
- All inputs from your video card (except vga as it doesn't support macOS)
- AppleSMC chip emulation (thanks to VirtualSMC)
- All iService (iCloud, iMessage, Facetime etc)
- All System updates (SIP Enable)
